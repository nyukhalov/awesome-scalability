# Awesome Scalability, Availability, and Stability Back-end Design Patterns
[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of selected readings to illustrate Scalability, Availability, and Stability Design Patterns in Back-end Development. Concepts are explained in the articles of notable engineers (Werner Vogels, James Hamilton, Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin, Tom White, etc) and high quality reference sources (highscalability.com, infoq.com, etc). Case studies are taken from battle-tested systems those are serving millions of users (Netflix, Instagram, Riot Games, LINE, Expedia, etc).

#### What if your Back-end went slow?
> Understand your problems: performance problem (slow for a single user) or scalability problem (fast for a single user but slow under heavy load) by reviewing [design principles](#principles). You can also check some [talks](#talks) of elite engineers from tech giants (Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc) to see how they build and scale their systems.

#### What if your Back-end went down?
> "Even if you lose all one day, you can build all over again if you retain your calm!" - Thuan Pham, CTO at Uber Technologies Inc.

#### Community Power

> Contributions are greatly welcome! You may want to take a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you find this project helpful, please help me share it to more and more people! Thank you very much!
